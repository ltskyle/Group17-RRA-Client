                          Remote Rehab Association was founded in 2023. Our founders are passionate about improving access to quality rehabilitation services for people who may have difficulty accessing traditional in-person care, such as those in remote or underserved areas. They saw a need for a company that could provide convenient, effective, and affordable remote rehabilitation services and set out to make it a reality.
